    "\n",
    "We can call this class to accomplish hyperparams tuning and return the best_params. This class can be used either independently, or as one of the tasks we conduct in the inner loop of nested cross-alidation. The structure should be consistent with the [FeatureSelector](https://github.com/MenaWANG/ML_toy_examples/blob/main/OOP%20for%20ML%20pipeline/Building%20FeatureSelector.ipynb).\n",
