## Welcome to My Machine Learning Playground 🚀

This repo is where I learn, explore and experiment with Machine Learning ideas and techniques. 🧪

I also utilize some toy examples to quickly develop Proof of Concepts (POCs) before committing time and resources to a full-scale implementation 🏄🏾‍♀️. POCs offer several advantages in a business context 😎, including but not limited to:

* **Rapid Validation (or Fail Fast🤪)**: POCs help validate the feasibility and viability of a machine learning project in a short timeframe. This prevents investing significant resources in an idea that might not work.
* **Stakeholder Buy-In👏**: POCs provide a tangible result that we can show to stakeholders, making it easier to gain their support and secure budget for the full project.
* **Baseline for Comparison📈**: POC performance provides a baseline against which we can compare the performance of the full-scale model. This helps in assessing the progress made and the actual impact of our machine learning solution.
* **Iterative Improvement🔄**: Results from a POC can be used to fine-tune and improve the full project. Lessons learned from a POC can guide us in making necessary adjustments.

All toy examples are reproducible and based on publicly available data or synthetic ones. Feel free to dive in and have fun with these examples. 🏖️
